You will, yet again, explore the same housing affordability dataset from the [American Housing Survey](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/pdrdatas_landing.html) as HW 8 and 9. In these exercises, you will develop a model for some of the relationships in the dataset using multiple and logistic regression.\n",

In general, you can always increase the polynomial order of the fit and get a model that fits the data better, however, this does not always produce the \"best\" model. There is always a trade-off between how good a model fits existing data and how useful its predictions are. This is commonly refered to as the [Bias-Variance trade-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biasâ€“variance_tradeoff)."
