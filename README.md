# DS10 Homeworks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks where you can work on DS10 exercises.

### Notebook 1

**Variables and values**: The first notebook explains how to use Jupyter and introduces variables, values, and numerical computation.

### Notebook 4

**Loops and Files**: This notebook presents the `for` loop and the `if` statement; then it uses them to speed-read *War and Peace* and count the words.

### Notebook 6

**Plotting**: This notebook introduces a plotting library, Matplotlib, and uses it to generate a few common data visualizations and one less common one, a Zipf plot.

### Notebook 7

**DataFrames**: This notebook presents DataFrames, which are used to represent tables of data.  As an example, it uses data from the National Survey of Family Growth to find the average weight of babies in the U.S.

### Notebook 8

**Distributions**: This notebook explains what a distribution is and presents 3 ways to represent one: a PMF, CDF, or PDF.  It also shows how to compare a distribution to another distribution or a mathematical model.

### Notebook 9

**Relationships**: This notebook explores relationships between variables using scatter plots, violin plots, and box plots.  It quantifies the strength of a relationship using the correlation coefficient and uses simple regression to estimate the slope of a line.

### Notebook 10

**Regression**: This notebook presents multiple regression and uses it to explore the relationship between age, education, and income.  It uses visualization to interpret multivariate models.  It also presents binary variables and logistic regression.
