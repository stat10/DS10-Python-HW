Feel free to open the Python notebook for [Lab 2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ElementsOfDataScience/blob/master/02_times.ipynb) for reference. You might need to import the `pandas` and `numpy` modules for this homework exercise. If you need instructions on how to submit the notebook, please look at the [HW01_variables](https://colab.research.google.com/github/stat10/DS10-Python-HW/blob/master/HW01_variables.ipynb) notebook."

For example, in the `haversine` function that was constructed in the Lab notebook, the second and third line are indented. As the second line is a comment (i.e. preceeded by #), indentation is not important. However, indentation of the third line is important. You can try not indenting it and see what happens. \n",
