    "**Exercise 1:** As you probably know, the novel Corona virus disease (COVID-19) has turned into a pandemic and has created health, social, economic, as well as political crises around the globe. In this exercise, we will explore data on the COVID-19 cases worldwide and look at the distributions of the death ratios. The data for this exercise was obtained from a [repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) operated by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. \n",

    "The original dataset contains three csv files coressponding to the number of daily worldwide confirmed cases, recovered cases, and cases resulting in death, respectively. The data is updated everyday and is cumulative, *i.e.*, the number of cases on any given day is a cumulative sum starting from January 22nd, 2020. So, the row corressponding to the last day contains the total number of cases reported till that day. \n",

    "We have removed some of the columns in the data and cleaned it up a bit and converted the cumulative data to deltas, *i.e.* the number of cases on each day only coressponds to the data from that day. This is simply to make the analysis a little easier to do."

(You might remember this from Lab02 and HW02) In order to do that first convert the `Date` column to a list, using the method `tolist()`. Now, write a `for` loop that repeats as many times as there are entries in the list. Within the `for` loop use the `pd.Timestamp` function on the current element of the list to convert the string to a `Timestamp` and either put it back in the same list or append to a new list.\n",
    "3. For the dates on the x-axis to look better. Use the function `plt.xticks()` with the keyword agrument of `rotation=45`. This will rotate the x-axis labels by 45 degrees and prevent overlapping labels."

For example, `round(ratio, 2)` will round the values in the variable ratio to 2 decimal places.\n",
