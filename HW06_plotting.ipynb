    "**Exercise 1:** In the last Python homework (HW05_dictionaries) we generated a dictionary containing the ages of the last 7 US Presidents (from Trump to Carter) when they took office. In this exercise, we want to visualize that data. One possible way to visualize this data is to generate a bar plot, with a bar for each President and the length of the bar indicating their age when they took office. We want to create a visualization like the one shown below.\n",
