    "**Exercise 1:** In the lab notebook you have seen how to access the elements of a list one-by-one using a `for` loop. In this excercise you will learn how to append elements to the end of a list. Let's say we want the list to contain the letters from your name, i.e., the first element of the list is the first letter of your name and so on. Translate the tasks below into Python code:\n",
    "1. In the cell below, start off by creating an empty list called `name_list`. You can do this by typing in the open and close square brakects without anything inside them and assigning it to `name_list`. \n",
    "2. Create another variable called `name` and assign it a string that contains your first name.\n",
    "3. Now write a `for` statement that will loop through the letters of your first name.\n",
    "4. Inside the loop, we want to take the current letter from the `name` string and append it to the list `name_list`. In order to do that we will use the function called `append`. The syntax for `append` is as follows. `list1.append(var1)`. In this example, `var1` will be appended, i.e., added as an element at the end, to the list `list1`. \n",
    "5. Finally, outside the `for` statement, print the list `name_list`. Remember, indentation is important in Python!"

    "In one of the previous labs and Python HW you have come across arrays. However, we haven't yet seen a very useful and powerful usecase of `NumPy` arrays, which is being able to access elements of the arrays using an index. By the way, elements of a list (or for that matter, characters in a string) can also be accessed using indices. In Python, the elements of a 2D array, for example the `yamaha_data` array, can be accesses by providing a row index and a column index. One important thing to keep in mind is that in Python indices start from 0 (not 1). The code below creates a 2D array `A`, prints out all of its elements, and shows how to obtain the element in the first row and first column, and second row and fifth column, respectively. Notice that the syntax is `array_name[row_index, column_index]`."

    "**e:** Now let's go ahead and calculate the average miles per gallon for the Yamaha scooter. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get the miles driven between each gas filling, we have to take a difference of two odometer readings, *i.e.*, subtract the one at the time of a filling from the one at the next time of filling. Then we would want to divide the miles driven between two fillings by the amount of gas filled to obtain miles per gallon. Finally, we would want to take the mean of the miles per gallon between each of the fillings.\n",

    "In terms of array operations, we want to subtract the odometer reading at say index `i` from the one at index `i+1`. This difference gives the distance travelled between two gas fillings. When we divide this distance by the amount of gas filled at the index `i`, we get the miles per gallon for that distance. Finally, the average can be computed by using the function `np.mean`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that the *Yamaha.txt* file has 14 entries, however since we need to take differences between successive entries, we will end up with 13 numbers for miles per gallon. So, the `for` statement to calculate the miles per gallon would need to repeat 13 times. We would also need a way to define the index `i` that goes from `0` to `13`. Python has a function called `range` that can be used to generate these indices. We will not go into the details of the function `range` right now because we will come back to it again. But the syntax for generating the indicies in a `for` loop is as follows: `for i in range(max_num):`. This line of code will generate `max_num` number of integers that will be assinged to the variable `i` starting from `0` to a value of `max_num - 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Translate the tasks below to Python code for calculating the average miles per gallon.\n",
    "1. Create an empty list called `mpg` to hold the miles per gallon computed between each gas filling.\n",
    "2. Write a `for` loop that repeats as many times as the number of rows in the array `yamaha_data` less one. (*Hint:* use `len(yamaha_data)` to find the number of rows in `yamaha_data`, then `len(yamaha_data) - 1` is the maximum number of integers you want to obtain using `range`.)\n",
    "3. Inside the `for` calculate the current miles per gallon by taking the difference between the odometer reading at `i+1` and `i`, divided by the gas filled at index `i`. Assign this value to a variable called `curr_mpg`.\n",
    "4. Append the `curr_mpg` value to the list `mpg`. See exercise 1 above for the syntax of `append`.\n",
    "5. Compute the average miles per gallon using the function `np.mean` and print out the value. You should get a value of `96.27371246852911`."
