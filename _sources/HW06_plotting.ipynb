Feel free to open the Python notebook for [Lab 6](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AllenDowney/ElementsOfDataScience/blob/master/06_plotting.ipynb) for reference. You will need to import the `matplotlib.pyplot` library for this. You might also need `numpy`."

    "**Exercise 1:** In the last Python homework (HW05_dictionaries) we generated a dictionary containing the ages of the last 7 US Presidents (from Trump to Carter) when they took office. In this exercise, we want to visualize that data. One possible way to visualize this data is to generate a bar plot, with a bar for each President and the length of the bar indicating their age when they took office. We want to create a visualization like the one shown below.\n",

In our case here, our x values are in the `names` list and the y values are in the `ages` list. Like in the Lab examples, you can suppress the result from the `bar` function by putting a semi-colon at the end. Your output should look like the image below.\n",

One option to keep the color names human readable is to use the colors specified in the [xkcd color survey](https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/).
