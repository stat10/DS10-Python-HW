Create a variable say `max_age` with a value of `0` and another say `oldest_pres` with the value of a blank string. In the `for` loop that iterates through the key value pairs of the dictionary write an `if` statement to check whether the current `value` *i.e.* age is greater than `max_age`. If it is, then replace the value of `max_age` by that `value` and replace the value of `oldest_pres` by the `key`. Finally, print out the variables `oldest_pres` and `max_age`."

    "\n",
    "First, if you go to the [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org) webpage you will notice that it says there are 61,329 free ebooks to download. Looking around the webpage for different books and the urls for the plain text files you might also notice that there is a specific pattern for the urls of the text files. For example one url to download *War and Peace* is `http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600.txt`. Simply by changing the number `2600`, which can from `1` to `61,329`, in the url one is able to access any of the 61,329 books. For example to download book number 1 the corressponding url would be `http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1/pg1.txt`."

    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Use your favorite search engine to help you find the function and its documentation. Also, you can use the function `np.arange(start, stop, step)` to generate an array of integers, where `start` is the integer you want to begin from, `stop` is one less than the integer at which you want to end, and `step` is the spacing bwtween the integers. Try out the following code to see how `np.arange` works."
